# MERN Stack To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do application built using the ViteJS for the frontend and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, and Node.js) for the backend. The application allows users to manage tasks, leveraging Axios for seamless communication between the React frontend and Express backend.

## Features

- **Create Task:** Easily add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Read Task:** View the list of existing tasks.
- **Update Task:** Edit and modify existing tasks.
- **Delete Task:** Remove tasks from the list.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing task data.
- **Mongoose:** MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **Express:** Backend framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **Node.js:** Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **React:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios:** HTTP client for making requests from React to the Express backend.
- **Vite:** Build tool for blazing-fast frontend development.
